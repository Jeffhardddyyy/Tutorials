<h2> Usages and Can and Cants </h2>
You <b> may </b> use any of these scripts at any point, you are <b> not required </b> to give me credit, but it is cool if you do!

<h2> My Request </h2>
I don't request for much, just please do not use these scripts for dangerous acts.

<h2> Why Am I doing This? </h2>
 I am making these tutorials because I want to give everyone a better understanding of how to be a programmer while still giving the motto of <i> "Anything Can Be Done If You Try!" </i> I am a teenager (as of Oct. 2017) and I want to make sure that everyone knows that programming isn't something that only a certain group or sex, or religion, can do. Programming is for everyone, and it is something that everyone should do.
